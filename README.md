# Show Me Where It Herz

Show Me Where It Hertz (or Hertz, for short) is a sound utility for making sine waves at specified arbitrary tones.
The original usecase is for identifying the exact pitch of a feedback source without benefit of a sophisticated sound board,
but the possibilities are figuratively endless.

Hertz is written mostly in SwiftUI, with a bit of UIKit to enable the slider to adjust volume or resolution based on verticial positioning of the drag state.
No network calls are made for app functionality, and the only data persisted to disk is for UI settings.

Please feel free to provide any feedback.
